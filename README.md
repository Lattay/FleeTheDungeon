Interaction: Create
Genre: Rogue Like

## Elevator pitch
A puzzle game where you want to escape a monster infested dungeon without fighting.
Move carefully and create obstacles to block the monsters and get out alive.

## Story

After an epic boss fight, you end all beaten up and basically empty handed at the lowest floor of the dungeon.
Sneak outside without getting caught by monsters.

## Mechanics
You move on square at a time on a grid.
The monsters may have different movement patterns but they are predictable.

You have a magic item that can create boulders/ice bloc/something else that will block the path of the monsters.

Get from one door to another without getting caught by monsters.
